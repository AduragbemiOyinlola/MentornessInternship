### Problem Statement:

This internship project aims to analyse a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using Power BI. The dataset comprises various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create comprehensive visualizations and insights that shed light on trends, patterns, and factors influencing the performance of listings. Through Power BI, interns will explore key metrics such as pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for improving the overall quality and competitiveness of the listings.

For the pricing and availability analysis, I used the data from the year 2022 the purpose of this to help owners make informed decisions for the year 2023.

- There were 852 available properties for the year 2022 for all available locations.
- A total of $177.25k was the revenue generated in this year.
- On average the *Entire home/apt* `room type` is more expensive compared to a *Private room*.
- The minimum cost of renting an *Entire vacation home* is $119, which is the most for `Property Type`.
